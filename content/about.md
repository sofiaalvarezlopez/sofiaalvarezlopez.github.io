I’m a Physics Ph.D. candidate at MIT working with Professor Salvatore Vitale on gravitational-wave astrophysics and data analysis. **I use Bayesian methods to study the properties and evolution of black hole and neutron star populations in the Universe.** At MIT, I’m part of the LIGO Laboratory (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) and the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. I’m grateful to be supported by the Thomas A. Frank Fellowship (2023–2024), the Mario Santo Domingo Fellowship (2024–2025), and the ACM SIGHPC Data Science Fellowship (2025–present).

Previously, I worked on detector characterization and data quality efforts to assist in gravitational-wave discoveries for LIGO. In 2024 and 2025, I received an NSF LIGO Laboratory Honorable Mention for Excellence in Detector Characterization and Calibration for leading the development of *GSpyNetTree*, a tool that identifies glitches in the presence of gravitational-wave signals for rapid event validation. I carried out this work as a Mitacs Globalink Summer Research Intern at the University of British Columbia, working with Jess McIver.

I grew up in Bogotá, Colombia, and graduated *summa cum laude* from Universidad de los Andes with degrees in Physics and Systems & Computing Engineering and a minor in Astronomy.
